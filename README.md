# wonderObjects
A silly script that comes in help when you need a name.

## Installation
This is a single bash shell script.
- download the archive
- extract it on your local disk
- copy the file bin/wonderObject.sh in a directory already in your path (e.g. $HOME/bin)

Alternatively you can clone this repository anywhere on your local disk and then create a link from bin/wonderObject.sh file in the repository to a directory in your path (e.g. $HOME/bin). In this way when you update the repository you automatically get the latest version installed.

## Usage
No brainer: type wonderObject.sh at command prompt.

## Bonus - fake excuses generator
As a bonus you'll get also makeExcuse.sh a handy script that uses wonderObject.sh to produce unlikley excuses.

## System Requirements
Every Un\*x derivative system should be able to run this script. I have tested it on Linux, but I expect no problems with Mac and cygwin/Windows machines.
